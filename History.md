# History

## Version 0.5-alpha

The second version is a complete rewrite of the first version. The new language is based on a lower language called the core-vocabulary that has a limited number of words. Words are created using this core-vocabulary and registered in a dictionary. English is the initial language, but the codebase is ready to support additional languages.

## Version 0.3-alpha

This first version of the interandroid language had almost three thousand words picked up manually from diverse open data sets. In order to facilitate eventual memorisation (by humans), often the interandroid name will be based on the phonetic of the word, usually in English. Names with similar pronunciation will conflict. The vocabulary was not really practical or easy to remember. The editor allowed translation between English and interandroid and vice-versa. In addition, you would have access to the phonetic of the whole sentence.
